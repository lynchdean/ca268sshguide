Type \"8080\" in the source port.\r\n   2. Underneath, select 'Dynamic' and 'Auto'.\r\n   3. Click 'Add'.\r\n* Select the 'Connection>SSH' category.\r\n* Tick the 'Don't start a shell or command at all' box.\r\n* Select the 'Session' category at the top.\r\n* Enter the host name (\\<username\\>@student.computing.dcu.ie) and port (22).\r\n* Select SSH as the connection type underneath.\r\n* Save the configuration under any name you like.\r\n\r\n##Chrome:\r\n* Create a copy of your Google Chrome shortcut. (eg. Desktop Shortcut)\r\n* Right click it and select properties.\r\n* In the 'Target' field, add the text below on to the end after the file path to chrome.exe, making sure there's a space in between.\r\n\r\n> --proxy-server=\"socks5://127.0.0.1:8080\"\r\n\r\n* It should look something like this:\r\n\r\n> \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe\" --proxy-server=\"socks5://127.0.0.1:8080\"\r\n\r\n* Rename the shortcut to anything you like and place it anywhere.\r\n\r\n##To launch:\r\n* Close any Chrome windows you have open.\r\n* Ensure no Chrome processes are running before launching or else it may not work. Do this by ending each Google Chrome task in Task Manager or by un-ticking the 'Continue running background apps when Chrome is closed' box in the Chrome advanced settings near the bottom.\r\n* In PuTTY, load your configuration and enter your password in the shell.\r\n* Launch Chrome using the new shortcut.\r\n* To test if it worked successfully, just check your IP address through the browser. It should be 136.206.x.\r\n\r\n",
